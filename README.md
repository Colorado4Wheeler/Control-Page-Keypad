# Control Page Keypad

This plugin for the [Indigo Domotics](http://www.indigodomo.com/) home automation platform that lets you set up a keypad on your control pages and use that keypad to control devices in Indigo.  The security keypad can be used for an Indigo alarm system or really any situation you can think of where you need to passcode lock an Indigo action.  The dimmer lets you punch in precisely what you want the brightness to be on one or more devices dynamically.  The sprinkler keypad lets you either enter a manual schedule to run now or modify a currently running schedule to add time to the zones.
